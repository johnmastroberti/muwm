# muWM

muWM is a dynamic tiling window manager, and absolutely nothing more.
Based on suckless's `dwm`, but keybindings and the statusbar are handled by other programs.
muWM is only responsible for placing windows on the screen, and absolutely nothing more.
The window manager is controlled by the program `muctl`, which can querry muWM for information and send it commands, similar to bspwm's `bspc`.
